# DrayTek Vigor 130
Although the DrayTek Vigor 130 had nothing to do with Ubiquiti or EdgeRouter it is still a great Modem that can work perfectly together with an EdgeRouter.
For this reason here are some information about the device. 

## Default IP
By default the device has the IP: `192.168.1.1` so you have to configure your computer to use an IP Address from the `192.168.1.1/24` range. 

Just connect the device to your computer and open [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1)

## Default Credentials
Username: *admin* 

Password: *admin*

## After connection to a computer
- Update the firmware. Download the latest firmware [here](https://www.draytek.com/support/latest-firmwares/) 
  - Unzip the zip file and use xxx.all for just an firmware update or xxx.rst for firmware update and default reset. 
  - As written [here](http://www.draytek.com/download_de/Vigor130/) the xxx.rst is prefered.  
- change the default credentials. Use a good password. (System Maintenance -> Administrator Password)
