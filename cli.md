In the background the device runs a VyOS. That means you can use the standard VyOs commands.

VyOs is based on Debian. If you type `sudo su` you get a `/bin/bash`

## Basic Stuff
confgirue -> brings you in the congiguration mode (you can compare that to *conf t* on cisco devices)
commit -> commits the changes 
save -> saves the chanes

Allways run commit and save if you want to save your configuration.

*exit* brings you back into "normal mode"
